Evaluating capability of non-temporal axis representations of Ngram data
========================================================================

We will be creating an interactive visualization that allows users to see
many words in a single frame.  The goal is to see if we can create a
scatter-plot visualization without an explicit temporal axis that rivals
traditional temporal axis based visualizations for identifying interesting
words and exploring word histories.

We will attempt to address issues of scale - allowing users to find
"interesting" words and/or inter-word relationships from a very large
dataset.  A web based solution in particular will have bandwidth
restrictions (implicit and explicit). We will explore creative way(s) for
allowing users to (interactively) define what makes words "interesting"

Goals
-----

* Learn about web-based design challenges (e.g. client/server interaction,
  bandwidth limitations, etc.)

* Learn how to program in javascript.

* Learn how to use the D3 graphics tookit

* See how good (or not) our Ngram Design Challenge designs are.

* Explore the Ngram data more, and perhaps find interesting words and
  relationships.


Milestones

Outcomes/Deliverables
---------------------

* web-based implementation of visualization for ngrams data

  - likely will be a hybrid of ideas from our Design Challenge designs

  - will have interactive features.

* Some sort of assessment of the "goodness" of our design with respect to
  more traditional designs.  Perhaps qualitative, perhaps empirical.
