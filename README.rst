Evaluating capability of non-temporal axis representations of Ngram data
========================================================================

We will be creating an interactive visualization that allows users to see
many words in a single frame.  The goal is to see if we can create a
scatter-plot visualization without an explicit temporal axis that rivals
traditional temporal axis based visualizations for identifying interesting
words and exploring word histories.


Goals
-----

* Create a web-based ngram visualization that allows users to see many words in a
  single view.

* Address issues of scale - allowing users to find "interesting" words
  and/or inter-word relationships from a very large dataset.  Web based
  solutions have bandwidth restrictions (implicit and explicit)

* Creative way(s) for allowing users to (interactively) define what makes
  words "interesting"

Outcomes/Deliverables
---------------------

* web-based implementation of visualization for ngrams data

  - likely will be a hybrid of ideas from our Design Challenge designs

  - will have interactive features.
